<!- We start with two buttons, "Add name" and "remove" with placeholder Name and begin Name array "" at 0
AND a randomize button

when you hit "add name," you add the next input box with "", add "" at next array position
AND you add a "remove" button beside the box.
AND you add a "randomize" name button.

WITH EACH ADDITIONAL "add name"
you add another input box AND you add a corresponding remove button AND you add a position in the array.

WHEN YOU FILL IN A Name
You change the string at that position of the array. (change on leaving input)

when you hit "subtract name" button, you delete that box (and any contents), and pop array a place.

When you hit the randomize button, you shuffle according to formula
You take first two positions and make an array and output that, and repeat.
Take oddball name and plug it into the zero array
Print the pairs, concatenating them in code
Have a return button
Hit that return button to come to the original screen.
